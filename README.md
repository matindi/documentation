## GIT
- Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating
work on those files among multiple people.
- At its core, itâ€™s a key-value pair of sha1 and its corresponding content blob.
 - Persistent - because the files are stored on the file system. 
 - Map - because it consists of a key value pair composed of : 
A blob of data. -- piece of content.(emphasize)
A SHA1 representation of that blob of data.	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)
Show an image of the table of the key value pair.
Git init and write object to git.
Define an object : the sha1 rep and the content.
(add the photo/representation of the object on the file system)
